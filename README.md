# Goal of final project
The primary objective of this comprehensive analysis was to establish associations between the severity of pedestrian crashes, categorized as either 'Fatal' or 'Non-Fatal,' and a diverse array of spatial-temporal attributes meticulously described within the dataset. By examining the interplay between these attributes and crash severity, this analysis seeks to derive actionable insights that hold immense value for road safety analysts and policymakers alike.
